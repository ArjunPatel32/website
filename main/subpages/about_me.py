            Iâ€™m a sophomore at UC Berkeley, where I study Astrophysics and Applied Math with a concentration in statistics. Iâ€™m very interested in solving the mysteries of the universe through my work and studies, and Iâ€™m currently engaged in research and projects that bridge data science and astrophysics.

            I currently work as a Data Science Intern at Dotlas, where I develop tools to analyze large datasets and automate data processes. Additionally, I recently started a new research position at the Rubin Observatory, focusing on advancing observational techniques and data analysis.
