            I've also worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics, 
            where I utilized COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® for modeling experiments on electromagnetic radiation detection. 
            I explored the use of terahertz radiation to differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues and 
            evaluated the impact of embedding tissues in paraffin wax to mimic real-life samples.
